# HEART-DISEASE-PREDICTION
The main objective of this application is to design and develop a model to predict the health status of a patient from cumulative collection of data. The major killer cause of human death is Heart Disease (HD). Hence it is essential to prognosticate the disease before it’s too late. This project aims to detect features at risk and classify the data based on those factors such that the prediction is done precisely using certain machine learning algorithms. Machine Learning (ML) is faster-emerging technology of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that contributes various algorithms for HD. Based on the proposed problem, ML provides different classification algorithms to divine the probability of patient having HD. In the proposed application the Naïve Bayes algorithm is trained with a relatively large dataset, which based on the symptoms given by the end user predicts the presence of disease. On the other hand the predicted accuracy is compared and analyzed with various other machine learning algorithms to ensure correctness of the calculated output. Hence the project is successfully created with help of requirement analysis, project plan, identifying features and functionalities, system validation and deployment. Thus this application would act as the efficient need of the hour to obtain exact outcomes for the health care organization to act on instantaneously.
